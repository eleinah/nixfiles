# Ellie's Nixfiles

Hi there, I'm starting to really enjoy Nix and NixOS so far.

I've been slowly moving my hosts to NixOS:
- mainstation -- main gaming and development rig
- travelstation -- my beloved laptop

and a few servers:
- boxoffice -- my media server stack w/ qBittorrent, Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Prowlarr, Radarr, and Sonarr
- choral -- a music server stack (this is planned)
